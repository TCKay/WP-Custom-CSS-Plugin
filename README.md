# WP-Custom-CSS-Plugin
A WordPress plugin which allows you to add mobile first css in your WordPress and publish it to a cacheable css file. 
Originally created before WordPress added their own custom css field, I still use this though because it has built in break points and it now uses CodeMirror so it looks like css. 
Basically it's a better version of Simple Custom CSS which dumps out your css is the head and can't be cached.
